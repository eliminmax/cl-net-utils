# cl-net-utils
A repository for simple command-line sysadmin and networking tools that I've made for myself, but am happy to share with the world.

This is what each file in the repository does:

* `zencli.sh`: a menu to quickly run nmap commands based on Zenmap's preconfigured profiles
  * depends: **nmap**
* `ec2-ssh-config.sh`: a tool to add a setting to the ssh config file for Amazon's EC2 IP addresses.
  * depends: **grepcidr**, **jq**, **wget**
