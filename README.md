# cl-net-utils
A repository for simple command-line sysadmin and networking tools that I've made for myself, but am happy to share with the world.

As of now, there is only one tool in the repository: `zencli.sh`. If I happen to make other similar tools, I'll put them in this repository.

This is what each file in the repository does:

  * `zencli.sh`: a menu to quickly run nmap commands based on Zenmap's preconfigured profiles
